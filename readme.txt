There are three portion of data distributed

On NCSA Dlta
/projects/bbtm/cli6/GlassAging/data/fluidConfigurations Stores the configurations for initializations
/projects/bbtm/cli6/glassyDynamics/data/N4096 contains log-spaced configurations for tauAlpha, stress autocorrelation, and energy derivatives with respect to gamma
						directly in the folder contains p0=3.80 for random T
						/p0=/ contains simulations for desired T
						
On the desktop
/home/chengling/Research/Project/Cell/glassyDynamics/localTest/2DmeltingPhase/N4096/ is for order paramter calculations
/home/chengling/Research/Project/Cell/glassyDynamics/localTest/chi4Test contains 100 short simulations of log-spaced configurations
/home/chengling/Research/Project/Cell/glassyDynamics/N4096 is a copy of NCSA delta data
/home/chengling/Research/Project/Cell/glassyDynamics/plots havs plot and tables
