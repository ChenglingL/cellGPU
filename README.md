# CellGPU

CellGPU implements GPU-accelerated algorithms to simulate off-lattice models of cells. Its current
two main feature sets focus on a Voronoi-decomposition-based model of two-dimensional monolayers
and on a two-dimensional dynamical version of the vertex model. CellGPU grew out of DMS'
"DelGPU" and "VoroGuppy" projects, and the current class structure still bears some traces of that
(please see the [contributing page](@ref contrib) for information on upcoming code refactoring and new planned
features!)

Information on installing the project and contributing to it is contained in the relevant
markdown files in the base directory. Documentation of the code is maintained via Doxygen... go
to the "/doc" directory, type "doxygen Doxyfile", and go from there.

A very rough outline of some of the main classes and the basic operating flow of the primary branches
of the code can be found [here](@ref basicinfo); this page is a good place to start before diving into
the code.
